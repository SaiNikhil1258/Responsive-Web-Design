## Introduction

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language known for its versatility and lightweight nature. It allows you to interact with web browsers and server environments, making it a fundamental language for web development.

## What You Should Already Know

Before diving into this documentation, it's helpful to have:

- A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
- Proficiency in HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
- Some programming experience is recommended. If you're new to programming, consider starting with beginner tutorials linked in the main JavaScript documentation.

## JavaScript vs. Java

JavaScript shares some similarities with Java but is fundamentally different. Understand the distinctions between these languages.

## Hello World

Get started with JavaScript by writing your first "Hello World" code and see it in action.

## Declaring Variables

Explore the different ways to declare variables in JavaScript using `var`, `let`, and more.

## Variable Scope

Understand the scope of variables, including global and local scope, and how it impacts your code.

## Global Variables

Learn about global variables and how to access them using the `window` object.

## Constants

Discover how to create read-only, named constants in JavaScript using the `const` keyword.

## Data Types

Explore the various data types in JavaScript, including primitives like Boolean, null, undefined, Number, String, Symbol, and Object.

## if...else Statement

Use the `if` statement to execute code based on logical conditions and make decisions in your programs.

## while Statement

Learn how to use the `while` statement to execute code repeatedly while a condition is true.

## Function Declarations

Define and use functions in JavaScript to encapsulate and reuse code.
